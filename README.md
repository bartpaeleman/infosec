# CYBER SECURITY - INFOSEC

## Objective
This repository is intended only for Cyber Defense purposes.

In order to be prepared, we collect information and tools to act in a protective mode, or prepare our environment against the seven steps in the kill chain with offensive tests.

## The Cyber Kill Chain

### 1. Reconnaissance
Researching, identifying, and selecting targets. This phase involves gathering information about the target system, such as email addresses, software versions, and network architecture.

### 2. Weaponization
Coupling a remote access trojan with an exploit into a deliverable payload, typically by means of an automated tool (weaponizer).

### 3. Delivery
Transmitting the weapon to the targeted environment. The three most prevalent delivery vectors for weaponized payloads by the attackers are email attachments, websites, and USB removable media.

### 4. Exploitation
After the weapon is delivered to the victim host, exploitation triggers the attackers' code. Most often, exploitation targets an application or operating system vulnerability, but it could also simply exploit the users themselves or leverage an operating system feature that auto-executes code.

### 5. Installation
Installing a remote access trojan or backdoor on the victim system allows the adversary to maintain persistence inside the environment.

### 6. Command and Control (C2)
Typically, compromised hosts must beacon out to an Internet controller server to establish a Command and Control (C2) channel. This channel allows the attacker to issue instructions to the compromised devices.

### 7. Actions on Objectives
After progressing through the first six phases, intruders can take actions to achieve their original goals. These typically include data exfiltration, data destruction, or encryption for ransom.
